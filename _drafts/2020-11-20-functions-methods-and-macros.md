# Functions e.g. area
# Methods e.g. rect.area

method syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by the method name, parentheses, and any arguments - from https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html

Plus also note: &self instead of rectangle: &Rectangle. ("Methods can take ownership of self, borrow self immutably as weâ€™ve done here, or borrow self mutably, just as they can any other parameter.")
