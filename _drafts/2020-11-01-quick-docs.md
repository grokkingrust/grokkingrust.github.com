Note: You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate. Instructions for using a crate are in each crate’s documentation. Another neat feature of Cargo is that you can run the cargo doc --open command, which will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other functionality in the rand crate, for example, run cargo doc --open and click rand in the sidebar on the left.
