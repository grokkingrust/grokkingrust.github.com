Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of a variable with a new one.  It's often used in situations in which you want to convert a value from one type to another type. Shadowing lets us reuse the guess variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as guess_str and guess for example

See [chapter 2 of the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) for more details.
