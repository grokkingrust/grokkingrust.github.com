Title: Rust is an expression-based language, but...


"Rust is an expression-based language." from https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html

"Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value." also from https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html

"The let y = 6 statement does not return a value, so there isnâ€™t anything for x to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such as C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those languages, you can write x = y = 6 and have both x and y have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust."

What about Go and Scala?
